 abstract = {I analyze how ownership structure and market geography jointly influence fast food prices. I estimate a model of demand and supply that accounts for the market geography and run counterfactual experiments that demonstrate how mergers affect prices. I find that the impact of mergers can be large, that this impact decreases as the merging outlets are farther apart, that mergers among market leaders generally increase prices more than mergers among weaker firms t and that mergers can increase prices even if the outlets are so far apart that neither outlet's presence affects prices at the other before the merger.},

 abstract = {This paper develops techniques for empirically analyzing demand and supply in differentiated products markets and then applies these techniques to analyze equilibrium in the U.S. automobile industry. Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

 abstract = {The ready-to-eat cereal industry is characterized by high concentration margins, large advertising to sales ratios, and numerous introductions of new products.  Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense non-price competition.  This paper empirically examines this conclusion.  In particular, I estimate price-cost margins importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three parts: (1) that which is due to product differentiation; (2) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (3) that due to potential price collusion.  The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost markups.  I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with non-collusive pricing behavior to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products influence the perceived quality of these products, and it is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

 abstract = {This paper studies estimators that make sample analogues of population orthogonality conditions close to zero. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of such estimators is established under the assumption that the observable variables are stationary and ergodic. Since many linear and nonlinear econometric estimators reside within the class of estimators studied in this paper, a convenient summary of the large sample properties of these estimators, including some whose large sample properties have not heretofore been discussed, is provided.},
